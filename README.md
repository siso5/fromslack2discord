# Overview

```
I created this because I found it inconvenient to use software that only sends notifications to Slack notifications. 
Simply put, this program forwards text (markdown supported) notifications sent to Slack, directly to Discord.

```

# Specifications

- If the same message is sent more than once by the same user (e.g., notifications for repeated edits and publications), it will not be sent again for 10 minutes.
- The transfer from Slack to Discord is limited to one specific channel of your choice.
- Only the statements of users listed in the environment â€» variables can be transferred.
Multiple users can be set for this permission.
You can send markdown-formatted messages from Slack directly to Discord.
URLs, messages, and emojis are supported.
Please note that attachments and images cannot be transferred.
Installation

- First, set up your .env (environment variables) referring to fromslack2discord/src/env.example.

- Regarding PORT, although port 3000 is specified in the program, the one written in the environment variables (src/.env) takes precedence.
